# Newspaper Reading

In Newspaper Reading , Basically  we capture the image using rasberry pi camera  and the python code in pi extracts the words from the image and then the blind people can hear the words using speaker.


# Face Recognition

In face recognition , Python code will take the image of the person in front of the camera label as person 1 and train the model in the real scenarion and if the same person comes in the camera again and it will detect the face of that and we can train the model with specfic persons in the real scenario
